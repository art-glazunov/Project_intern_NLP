# Project_intern_NLP 
by Artem Glazunov

 My submission of a test NLP assignment on Lenta.ru dataset. 
 
 Includes theory and my solution of a task.
 
 I also put some html files for a faster review. 
 In these html files you can see better rendered notebooks and interactive visualisations of extracted topics, so check it out;)
 
 And I also want to note, that in Theory file you can find a brief description of a practical part with a final model.
